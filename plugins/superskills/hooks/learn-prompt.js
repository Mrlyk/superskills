// They are per-CLI because file I/O works differently. Claude Code edits via
// dedicated Read/Write/Edit tools, so the hook also withholds Bash and the
// guardrail can forbid shell outright. Codex performs file I/O THROUGH the shell
// (apply_patch / cat), so forbidding shell would leave it unable to read or write
// the wiki at all; instead it is sandboxed to workspace-write and told to touch
// only the learnings directory and never git/commit.
